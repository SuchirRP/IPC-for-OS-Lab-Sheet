We will first define a macro called *max* of the value *10*, along with an array stack of the size *max*. Then, we will define two mutex objects with the names *pop_mutex* and *push_mutex*. To use the *stack*, we will initialize the value of *top* to *-1*. We will also define two variables of the type *pthread_t*, with the names *tid1* and *tid2*, to store two thread identifiers.\
We will invoke the *pthread_create* function to create the first thread, and we will assign the identifier returned by the function to the variable *tid1*. The thread will be created with the default attributes, and we will execute the push function to create this thread.\
We will invoke the *pthread_create* function again to create the second thread, and we will assign the identifier returned by the function to the variable *tid2*. This thread is also created with the default attributes, and we will execute the *pop* function to create this thread. On the screen, we will display the message *Both threads are created*.\
In the *push* function, we will invoke the *pthread_mutex_lock* method and pass the *mutex* object *push_mutex* to it to lock it. Now, if any other thread asks for the *push_mutex* object, it will need to wait until the object is unlocked.\
Then, the *mutex* object *pop_mutex* will be locked by the first thread. We will be asked to enter the value to be pushed to the stack. The entered value will be assigned to the variable *n*. The value of *top* will be incremented to *0*. The value that we enter will be pushed to the location *stack[0]*.\
Next, we will invoke the *pthread_mutex_unlock* and pass the *mutex* object *pop_mutex* to it to unlock it. Also, the mutex object *push_mutex* will be unlocked. At the bottom of the *push* function, we will display the message *Value is pushed to stack*.
